Final R Project 

####################################
Which Data I used : 
I only used the fireincident data files, from the years of 2007-2015, to analyze whether or not there was an increase in the number of fires caused by electrical malfunctions over the years of 2007-2015

Hello Professor Wright, 

Many believe there is a disconnect between college students and professors. 
I also believe that. In college, it is often difficult to establish a great student/professor relationship.
However, I spoke with some of my classmates and we agreed that you have done a fantastic job of being an amazing, effective, yet different college instructor.
Your are turly a great professor. You have been so direct and so honest in teaching us how to utilize such a powerful tool like R to help visualize data concerning issues that revolve around us in the world today. Thank you so much for such a wonderful and enriching class.
Though there were moments where I felt lost, I truly believe your class has made a difference in the way I look at teaching in University and research interests as well.
I just want to take this opportunity to thank you for such a wonderful class.

Regards, 
Tigran Melkonian
